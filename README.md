# Dispatch - Experimental Class Version

This is an experimental version of Dispatch converted to class-based to improve
testability. A procedural facade is also implemented so it can be used in exactly the
same way as normal Dispatch.

A few enhancements are included e.g. a class autoloader. Just because.

*This is hacked code intended as proof-of-principle. Yes, it's ugly - I know.*

The test sub directory has some very crude tests done with an adaptation of
the test class from Fat Free Framework. These are also a proof-of-principle
to show that the class-based version can be properly tested if someone has the
time to write the tests.....
